# üéØ Chess Game Project Roadmap

## üßò Project Mantra

> "In this project, we commit to:
> - Writing code that is not just functional, but exemplary
> - Implementing features with thorough planning and foresight
> - Using advanced programming techniques and design patterns
> - Maintaining professional standards in every commit
> - Testing thoroughly and documenting clearly
> - Reviewing code with attention to detail
> - Building for maintainability and scalability"

## üìù Git Workflow

### Initial Setup
1. [ ] Create and switch to the appropriate development branch:
   - For backend:
     ```bash
     git checkout -b dev/backend
     ```
   - For frontend:
     ```bash
     git checkout -b dev/frontend
     ```

### Feature Implementation Process
For each feature/change:
1. Create a feature branch from the relevant dev branch:
   - For backend features:
     ```bash
     git checkout -b feat/backend/feature-name dev/backend
     ```
   - For frontend features:
     ```bash
     git checkout -b feat/frontend/feature-name dev/frontend
     ```
2. Make changes following TDD:
   - Write tests first
   - Implement feature
   - Ensure tests pass
3. Commit changes with semantic messages:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat(component): description
   
   - Detailed bullet points
   - Of changes made
   - And their impact"
   ```
4. Push and merge:
   ```bash
   git push origin feat/backend/feature-name  # or feat/frontend/feature-name
   # Create PR to dev/backend or dev/frontend as appropriate
   # Review, approve, merge
   ```
5. Delete feature branch after merge (optional)
