# üîÑ Professional Git Workflow & Branch Management

## üéØ Overview

This document defines the complete Git workflow and branching strategy for the Chess Game project. It ensures consistent, professional development practices across the team.

## üìù Git Workflow

### Initial Setup
1. [ ] Create and switch to the appropriate development branch:
   - For backend:
     ```bash
     git checkout -b dev/backend
     ```
   - For frontend:
     ```bash
     git checkout -b dev/frontend
     ```

### Feature Implementation Process
For each feature/change:
1. Create a feature branch from the relevant dev branch:
   - For backend features:
     ```bash
     git checkout -b feat/backend/feature-name dev/backend
     ```
   - For frontend features:
     ```bash
     git checkout -b feat/frontend/feature-name dev/frontend
     ```
2. Make changes following TDD:
   - Write tests first
   - Implement feature
   - Ensure tests pass
3. Commit changes with semantic messages:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat(component): description
   
   - Detailed bullet points
   - Of changes made
   - And their impact"
   ```
4. Push and merge:
   ```bash
   git push origin feat/backend/feature-name  # or feat/frontend/feature-name
   # Create PR to dev/backend or dev/frontend as appropriate
   # Review, approve, merge
   ```
5. Delete feature branch after merge (optional)

### Branch Synchronization Checklist
Before starting a new feature branch from dev, always ask:
- Do I need to merge another feature branch into dev to ensure all required changes are present?
- Is dev up to date with all completed or in-progress features that my new work will depend on?
- If not, merge the necessary branches into dev and resolve any conflicts before branching.

## üîß Professional Git Workflow & Branch Management

### Pre-Branching Validation
Before creating any feature branch:
1. **Ensure dev branch is clean and up-to-date:**
   ```bash
   git checkout dev/backend  # or dev/frontend
   git pull origin dev/backend
   git status  # Should be clean
   ```
2. **Check for pending dependencies:**
   - Review open PRs that might affect your work
   - Check if any breaking changes are in progress
   - Verify CI/CD pipeline is green
3. **Validate branch naming convention:**
   - Format: `feat/backend/feature-name` or `feat/frontend/feature-name`
   - Use kebab-case for feature names
   - Keep names descriptive but concise

### Feature Branch Creation & Development
1. **Create feature branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/backend/feature-name dev/backend
   ```
2. **Follow atomic commits:**
   - One logical change per commit
   - Use conventional commit format:
     ```bash
     git commit -m "feat(component): add move validation
     
     - Implement pawn movement rules
     - Add diagonal capture validation
     - Include edge case handling for first move
     
     Closes #123"
     ```
3. **Regular synchronization with dev:**
   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   git rebase origin/dev/backend  # Keep history linear
   ```

### Pull Request Workflow
1. **Pre-PR Checklist:**
   - [ ] All tests pass locally
   - [ ] Code follows style guidelines
   - [ ] Documentation is updated
   - [ ] No console.log or debug code
   - [ ] Branch is up-to-date with dev
   - [ ] Commit history is clean and logical

2. **PR Creation Standards:**
   - **Title:** Clear, concise description
   - **Description:** Detailed explanation with:
     - What was changed and why
     - How to test the changes
     - Screenshots for UI changes
     - Breaking changes (if any)
     - Related issues/PRs
   - **Labels:** Appropriate tags (bug, feature, enhancement, etc.)
   - **Assignees:** Relevant team members
   - **Reviewers:** At least 2 reviewers for significant changes

3. **PR Template:**
   ```markdown
   ## Description
   Brief description of changes

   ## Type of Change
   - [ ] Bug fix
   - [ ] New feature
   - [ ] Breaking change
   - [ ] Documentation update

   ## Testing
   - [ ] Unit tests added/updated
   - [ ] Integration tests pass
   - [ ] Manual testing completed
   - [ ] Performance impact assessed

   ## Checklist
   - [ ] Code follows style guidelines
   - [ ] Self-review completed
   - [ ] Documentation updated
   - [ ] No breaking changes (or documented)
   ```

### Code Review Process
1. **Review Requirements:**
   - Minimum 2 approvals for merge
   - All CI checks must pass
   - No merge conflicts
   - Code coverage maintained/improved

2. **Review Focus Areas:**
   - Code quality and readability
   - Security implications
   - Performance impact
   - Test coverage adequacy
   - Documentation completeness
   - Error handling
   - Edge cases considered

3. **Review Response:**
   - Address all comments before merge
   - Request clarification if needed
   - Update PR description if requirements change

### Merge Strategy & Conflict Resolution
1. **Merge Strategy:**
   - Use "Squash and merge" for feature branches
   - Use "Rebase and merge" for hotfixes
   - Never use "Merge commit" strategy

2. **Conflict Resolution:**
   ```bash
   # When conflicts occur during rebase
   git rebase --abort  # If you need to start over
   # OR resolve conflicts manually, then:
   git add .
   git rebase --continue
   ```

3. **Post-Merge Cleanup:**
   ```bash
   git checkout dev/backend
   git pull origin dev/backend
   git branch -d feat/backend/feature-name  # Delete local branch
   git push origin --delete feat/backend/feature-name  # Delete remote branch
   ```

### Quality Gates & Automation
1. **Required Checks:**
   - [ ] Linting passes (ESLint, Prettier)
   - [ ] Type checking passes (TypeScript)
   - [ ] Unit tests pass (min 80% coverage)
   - [ ] Integration tests pass
   - [ ] Security scan passes
   - [ ] Performance benchmarks maintained

2. **Automated Workflows:**
   - Pre-commit hooks for linting
   - CI/CD pipeline for testing
   - Automated dependency updates
   - Security vulnerability scanning

### Branch Lifecycle Management
1. **Active Branch Maintenance:**
   - Keep feature branches short-lived (< 1 week)
   - Regular rebases to avoid drift
   - Delete merged branches promptly

2. **Long-Running Feature Branches:**
   - For complex features, create intermediate PRs
   - Use feature flags for partial deployments
   - Regular sync with dev to minimize conflicts

3. **Emergency Procedures:**
   - Hotfix branches: `hotfix/critical-issue-name`
   - Immediate merge to main and dev
   - Cherry-pick to release branches if needed

## üìã Quick Reference Commands

### Daily Workflow
```bash
# Start new feature
git checkout dev/backend
git pull origin dev/backend
git checkout -b feat/backend/feature-name

# During development
git add .
git commit -m "feat(component): description"
git push origin feat/backend/feature-name

# Sync with dev
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/dev/backend

# After PR merge
git checkout dev/backend
git pull origin dev/backend
git branch -d feat/backend/feature-name
```

### Conflict Resolution
```bash
# During rebase conflict
git status  # See conflicted files
# Edit files to resolve conflicts
git add .
git rebase --continue

# Or abort and start over
git rebase --abort
```

### Emergency Hotfix
```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b hotfix/critical-issue
# Make changes
git commit -m "fix: critical issue description"
git push origin hotfix/critical-issue
